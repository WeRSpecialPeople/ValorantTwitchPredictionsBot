# ValorantTwitchPredictionsBot

This project will be used for the potential Twitch Predictions Bot for Valorant. If we get it working for Valorant, we can also then get it working for League, TFT, etc. 

No code is available yet, as we are waiting for an API key from Riot Games.

Can potentially also throw a message in Discord communities about the Prediction, so they are also aware of it (or match stats).
